# Tiny College ERD
This document details the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) requirements for a case study focused on Tiny College. It provides an outline of the various relationships between entities such as professor, school, department, course, class, student, semester, room, and building, based on the specific business rules of Tiny College. The ERD is designed using Crow's Foot notation to represent the cardinality and optionality of the relationships, like the connection between professors and departments, courses and classes, and students and their respective majors. The exercise emphasizes the importance of identifying key attributes and foreign keys, ensuring data integrity, and accommodating the optional relationships, such as undeclared majors or research-focused professors who may not teach classes. This assignment demonstrates the application of database design principles using MS Visio for visual representation.
